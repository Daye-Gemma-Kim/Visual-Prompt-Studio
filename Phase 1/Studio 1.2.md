Prompt : Create a transparent acrylic cube lid and a halved papaya placed on a white base. First, the papaya has white skin, and its flesh inside is orange. Within that orange flesh, black seeds appear with a bumpy texture, and inside those seeds are round shapes made of gold foil. Arranged in a circle around the papaya are eight flowers. They form a shape surrounding the papaya. The flowers have white leaves, and the stamen-like parts in the center are orange. They share the same color as the papaya. The flower buds face the papaya, while the white leaves and orange stamens face outward.
